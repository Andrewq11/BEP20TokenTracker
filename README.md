# defiTokenTracker
This program uses Selenium and PySimpleGUI to attain token holdings and related 
info for any BEP20 address. 
If you want to use this program for your own wallet, you must update the 
walletAddress variable with your BEP20 wallet address and manually input the 
purchase price for each token. If you do not care for the PL for some tokens,
input the purchase price as 0.
